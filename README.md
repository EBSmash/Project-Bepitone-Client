# Project Bepitone

It all started as an idea... An idea that bep could reign over the skies of 2b2t. The glorious word shining down upon the other worldly landscape of 2b2t spawn. So on that day we began, we began what would become... Bepitone.

## The speech
I have a bep!

I have a dream that one day, the skies of 2b2t will be adorned with the beautiful artwork of Bepitone. I dream that the word "bep" will shine down upon the otherworldly landscape of 2b2t spawn, bringing joy and inspiration to all who behold it.

This dream started as an idea, a spark of creativity that caught fire in the hearts of a few dedicated individuals. They knew that the sky was not a barrier to art, but rather a canvas waiting to be painted. And so, on November 18th, 2022, the first successful test of Bepitone was launched into the skies of 2b2t.

The release of Bepitone to a select group of SBA members marked the beginning of a new era. It was time to start "beppin," to create something beautiful and unique in this strange and wondrous world. The race was on, and a leaderboard was established to track the progress of each bepper.

The development of Bepitone was not without its challenges. But with the addition of the talented BabbaJ to the dev team, the project gained new momentum. And on February 1st, 2023, Bepitone was finally complete. The word "bep" was now a shining beacon of hope and creativity in the sky, and the dream had been realized.

So let us continue to dream, to create, and to bep. For the sky is not the limit, but only the beginning of what we can accomplish together.
